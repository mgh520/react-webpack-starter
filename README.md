# react-webpack-starter
Simple bare-bones repository to get started using React, webpack, and css modules.

# Includes:
* react
* webpack with configuration for dev server with hot reload
* css-loader and style-loader

# Disclaimer
I am pretty much a n00b at the majority of this javascript tooling stuff but I found I had to piece together a bunch of different tutorials and blogs to get a relatively simple and straightforward skeleton I liked for starting a react project.  

I know create-react-app exists but it seems huge to me and a total black-box for how this stuff works. You can of course eject, but the setup seemed so wildly complex that I ejected from the eject pretty quickly.

Constructive feedback is welcome!
